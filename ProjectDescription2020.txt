Project 3 - Data analysis in type 1 diabetes modeling (Profs. Lisette de Pillis and Blerta Shtylla)
We plan to explore techniques, such as data assimilation methods, to connect data sets to dynamical systems models, with the goal of creating a testbed for emerging treatments for type 1 diabetes. Techniques such as deep learning promise to predict the future without mechanistic knowledge, learning the structure directly from the data, but they are limited in settings with sparse, irregular,inaccurate data, and they do not bring much understanding about the patient or the disease beyond their predictions. Data assimilation (DA), known also as state space models, point processors, Kalman filters, and linear dynamical systems, is a regression method meant to solve inverse problems (estimating model parameters), often in the context of solving a forward problem (issuing a forecast) and was initially developed in contexts of space travel by Kalman and Brownian motion by Thiele. Conceptually, DA takes a model believed to represent a system being studied and synchronizes the model with data by estimating states and parameters of the system. In essence, DA is a family of regression methods that project data onto a physiologically meaningful mechanistic model the way linear regression projects data onto simpler linear models and the way deep learning projects data onto more flexible but data-hungry neural networks. DA has advanced over the decades from its original formulation as a linear, stochastic method to more recently developed nonlinear approaches.  We will work through an example of DA with published data from a type 2 diabetes patient that has a two-day sample of sparse finger-prick glucose measurements and meal data. Our hope is to extend this approach to glucose measurements in mouse models and eventually human models of type 1 diabetes to forecast point of disease onset using data from literature and from our collaborators.
