\section{Acknowledgements}

We would like to express our gratitude towards all of the advisors that have assisted us throughout our work this summer. In particular, we thank Professor Lisette de Pillis and Professor Blerta Shtylla for all of their previous work on the Type 1 diabetes model, as well as for the constant guidance, feedback, and support they have provided us. We thank Professor Christina Edholm for her endless encouragement and advice, and for always being an excellent set of eyes and ears to discuss our work with. Finally, we thank An Do for volunteering to review our work, teaching us about her previous experiences on this project, and always providing encouragement throughout the summer. Without their help and the knowledge they have shared with us, the work presented here would not have been possible!\\

Additionally, we thank Harvey Mudd College, Professor Susan Martonosi, and the entire REU organizing team for giving us the opportunity to work on a project we have truly become passionate about over the past months. While the circumstance of a global pandemic altered our original plans for this program, the dedication of the college and its faculty to providing us with research experience was incredible.\\

Lastly, we would like to thank the NSF for providing the funding to make this research and the REU program possible.
