Figures: 

averagethenfit_pso_dram_comp.fig/.png
	figure comparing glucose predictions of PSO/MCMC paramterized using the acute averaged
	data set

final_avgComp.fig/.png
	figure comparing glucose predictions of all 4 algorithms. PSO/MCMC paramterized using
	the acute averaged data set and UKFs ran algorithms multiple times then averaged
	final parameter values
