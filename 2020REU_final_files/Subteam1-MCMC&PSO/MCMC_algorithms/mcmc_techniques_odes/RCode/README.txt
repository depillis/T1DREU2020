CONTENTS

"R codes model" contains the required information and codes for the performance the MCMC approaches execution, organized by model. MCMC codes for simulations data (model 1, model 2 and model 3) and experimental data (model 4 and model 5) are located in the main folder.  Also codes for parameters priors estimation are placed in this folder.

From Model 1 to  3, folders for every noise level with the simulations' data and the initial pararmeters are given, also the R code for its estimations. In Model 4 and Model 5, contains a folder called as "realistic" with the initial parameters data and the R code for its estimation.

All models folders contains their real parameters sets, c file with their ODEs, their SBML files and their likelilhood computation R codes. Addittionaly, folder for Models 4 and 5 has initial species concentration values and the observable species values.
