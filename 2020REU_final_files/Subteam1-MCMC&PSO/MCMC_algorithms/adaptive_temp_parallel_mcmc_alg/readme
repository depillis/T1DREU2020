There are two supplementary files:

- proofs.zip      LaTeX-sources including the supplementary material
- apt-codes.zip   Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm

Note: the supplement-pt.tex contained in proofs.zip requires to be
compiled in the same directory with the main document in order to get
the cross-references correct.
