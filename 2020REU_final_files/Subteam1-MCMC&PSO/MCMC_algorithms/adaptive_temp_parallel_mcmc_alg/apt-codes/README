This is a Matlab/Octave implementation of the Adaptive Parallel 
Tempering algorithm introduced in the research paper 

   http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1076

The script file "test.m" provides a simple example how to use the
implementation.

The spatial imaging example in the paper is under the 'Ising' folder.
