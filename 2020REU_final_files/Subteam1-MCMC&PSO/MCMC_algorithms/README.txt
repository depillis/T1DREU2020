MCMC_algs: a repository for different MCMC algorithm methods

This folder contains various MCMC algorithms implemented by a variety of sources

1) Adaptive single-chain MCMC: 		ADAPTIVE_MCMC
2) Adaptive Parallel Tempering: 	adaptive_temp_parallel_mcmc_alg
3) Comparison of MCMC methods: 		mcmc_techniques_odes
	The comparison included Metropolis-Hastings, parallel tempering MCMC, adaptive MCMC, and parallel adaptive MCMC. 

We did not write these codes and they were not used in any of our parameterizations of both the Lotka-Volterra and T1D models, however as there are many MCMC methods, we think it is useful to have a folder of the methods that we did not use for future use.
