workspaces

This folder contains the workspaces (with all their variables) that were used to generate 
results and figures found in the HMC REU Summer 2020 final report.
The folders are divided by the data on which the DRAM parameterization was run.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) jul10_avg_run1(noIC)_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with
	averaged data; (noIC) refers to not running the parameterization routine with 
	the initial conditions as parameters

	- generated figures in figures/average

2) jul13_mouse3_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with Mouse 3 data;
	(noIC) refers to not running the parameterization routine with 
	the initial conditions as parameters

	- generated figures in figures/mouse3

3) jul10_mouse6_run1(noIC)_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with 
	Mouse 6 data; (noIC) refers to not running the parameterization routine with 
	the initial conditions as parameters

	- generated figures in figures/mouse6

4) jul13_mouse11_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with Mouse 11;
	although there this is not labelled with (noIC) we do not run the parameterization 	routine with the initial conditions as parameters

	- generated figures in figures/mouse11
	
5) jul14_avg_wPriors_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with averaged 
	data with log-normal prior; although there this is not labelled with (noIC) we do 	not run the parameterization routine with the initial conditions as parameters

	- generated figures in figures/average_wPriors
