The folders are divided by the data on which the DRAM parameterization was run.

jul10_avg_run1(noIC)_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with averaged data

jul13_mouse3_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with Mouse 3 data

jul10_mouse6_run1(noIC)_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with Mouse 6 data

jul13_mouse11_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with Mouse 11

jul14_avg_wPriors_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal: workspace for parameterization with averaged data with log-normal prior
