average

This folder contains the figures from running the DRAM parameterization routine using
the averaged acute data set

Conditions of the parameterization were:
- Li averaged data
- Model: NOD w/wave
- uninformative prior: uniform

Figures and .csv were generated by variables in the workspace 
"workspaces/jul10_avg_run1(noIC)_acute_NOD_waveOn_lietal.mat"

Figures marked with * appear in the final write up
