comparison

This folder contains the figures from comparing various runs of the DRAM algorithm on 
different data sets

Figures marked with * appear in the final write up
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 3_6_11_avg_finalfig.fig
	plot of glucose predictions from DRAM parameterizations using Mouse 3, 6, 11, and
	averaged data with the respective raw data plotted on top; time span 0 to 350 days

* dram_priorComp.fig
	plot of the glucose prediction from the DRAM parameterization w/log-normal and w/log-
	uniform priors with averaged data plotted over; time 0 to 350 days
	
* mouse6_avg_paramComp_SIONLY.fig
	bar chart of means with error bars (1 standard deviation) of the parameters delta_B, 
	SI and alpha_eta however the .png version of this figures has erased the bars for 
	delta_B and alpha_eta so the final figure only has the SI bars

* mouse6_avg_paramComp1.fig
	bar chart of means with error bars (1 standard deviation) of the parameters delta_B,
	alpha_eta, and eta

* mouse6_avg_paramComp2.fig
	bar chart of means with error bars (1 standard deviation) of the parameters GI and
	beta_eta
	
* PDFs_3_6_11_avg.fig
	plots of PDFs for the 10 parameters from DRAM runs using the data sets from Mouse
	3, 6, 11, and averaged

* PDFs_6_avg.fig
	plots of PDFs for the 10 parameters from DRAM runs using the Mouse 6 and averaged
	data sets
	
* visval_avg_mouse6_comp.fig
	plots of glucose predictions from the Mouse 6 and averaged data parameterizations
	with raw acute data plotted over	

* allState_avg.fig
	 plots of 12 T1D ODE states predictions using parameter means from averaged data 
	 parameterization

* allState_comp_3_6_11_avg.fig
	plots of 12 T1D ODE states predictions using parameter means from Mice 3, 6, 11, and 
	averaged data parameterizations

* allState_mouse6.fig
	plots of 12 T1D ODE states predictions using parameter means from Mouse 6 data
	parameterization
	
* mouse6_importantStates.fig
	plots of 4 T1D ODE states predictions using parameter means from Mouse 6 data
	parameterization; states are Apoptotic beta cells, insulin, effector T cells,
	and Regulatory T cells
