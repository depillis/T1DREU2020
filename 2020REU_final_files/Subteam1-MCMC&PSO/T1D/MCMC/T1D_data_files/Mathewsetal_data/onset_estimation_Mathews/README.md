# histfit

The `acute-age-onset.csv` and `progressive-age-onset.csv` have the acute mouse data and progressive mouse data, respectively, from Figure E of the Mathews paper through Grabit. Not every point was grabbed, unfortunately.

Run `histogram.m` to look at the histograms and lognormal fittings of each dataset.
