RUN LOG

JUN 23
3 runs with Version 2 parameter set
- must run with parameters printing in T1Dfun_r.m for DRAM to accept candidates

run4 with Version 1 parameter set
- must run with parameters printing in T1Dfun_r.m

run1 & run2 - 7 important + eta_vary + time parameters; only use model.sigma2 (mse); progressive
run3 & 4 - 7 important + eta_vary parameters; only use model.sigma2; progressive
run5 - 7 important + eta_vary parameters; use model.sigma2 + model.S20 + model.N0; progressive
    - main difference is that in the dram chain, sigma2chain is now being saved where previously it was not

=================================================
Noticing that we cannot really parameterize all 41 parameters --> I think the parameter space is too large for DRAM to search/handle
EVIDENCE:
When I run DRAM on all 41, it cannot accept any parameters. All but the first candidate set are rejected so rejection rate is 0.9999 and the whole algorithm takes < 10 sec. However, when I decrease the number of parameters (15), DRAM is able to search and accept the parameter space. I think we are running into that curse of dimensionality here and I am not really sure how to address this, nor am I sure of what the upper limit of number of parameters should be

July runs
- run with Li data only - averaged
