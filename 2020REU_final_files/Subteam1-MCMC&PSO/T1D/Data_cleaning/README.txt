T1D_data_files

This folder contains the folders of data for Mathews et al and Li et al data. 
Duplicates of this folder (with some modifications) also exist throughout the subteam1 folders.

We have specified this folder for unmodified versions of the data that we use in the 
two parameterizations of T1D: PSO and DRAM MCMC.

Duplicates of these folders exist in other sub-directories within Subteam1-MCMC&PSO directory

NOTE that we only use Lietal data for the T1D parameterizations
