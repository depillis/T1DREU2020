T1D_data_files

This folder contains the folders of data for Mathews et al and Li et al data. 

We have specified this folder for unmodified versions of the data that we use in the 
two parameterizations of T1D: PSO and DRAM MCMC.

Duplicates of these folders exist (with some modifications) in other sub-directories within Subteam1-MCMC&PSO directory

NOTE that we only use Lietal data for the T1D parameterizations
