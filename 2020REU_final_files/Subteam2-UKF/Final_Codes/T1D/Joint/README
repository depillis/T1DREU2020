This folder contains code to run the Joint UKF on the T1D model using Li data. Additionally, it includes files to produce many of the figures seen in the final writeup. 
The files do the following:

all_values_important_multiple_eta.csv - contains a record of all the best fit parameters for each mouse

dat1.csv-dat11.csv - data for Mice 1-11 from Li et al

Get_Initial_Conditions.m - gets the state values for the ODE system at a given time point

Joint_allparams.m - main file, runs the Joint UKF for all parameters in the system on the Li data for specified mouse and number of runs. (eta is constant)

MeasurementFcn.m - measurement function for the UKF, returns balue of glucose

ODE_allparams.m - 12 equation ODE system for T1D, value of eta is 0.01

ODE_allparams2.m - 12 equation ODE system for T1D, value of eta is 0.018

Produce_Full_Figure_joint.m - produces figures with all acute and progressive results from paper

T1D_ODE_Parameters.m - file containing all the baseline parameter values. Used for initialization

UKF_allparams.m - code to run the Joint UKF

GetBoxPlots.m - code to create boxplots for parameters that change more than 1%

StateSimulations.m - code to create plots of all the simulated states for the estimated parameters

All other files are simply used for simple algebra purposes.
