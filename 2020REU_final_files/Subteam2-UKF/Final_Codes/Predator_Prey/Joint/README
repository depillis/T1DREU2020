This folder is meant for using the Joint UKF to perform estimation of states and parameters on the Lotka-Volterra system. The purpose of these files is the following:
-HaresLynxData - the raw data the UKF utilizes
-JointMain.m - the main file to run the estimation
-Lotka_Volterra_Model.m - contains set up of ODEs for the model that is used in the ODE solver throughout
-MeasurementFcn.m - set up of the measurement function for the UKF
-UKF.m - performs ALL iterations of the Joint UKF algorithm
-Joint_UKF_Real_Data_Figures - produces figures found in the paper (as well as some extras)

Note that running JointMain.m will produce all figures automatically and the run time is pretty fast, around 10 seconds or so.

All other files are needed for some linear algebra and have not been altered since this code was received from Chow-Ferrer.
