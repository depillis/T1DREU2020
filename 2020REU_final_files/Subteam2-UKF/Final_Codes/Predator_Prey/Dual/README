This folder contains the code to run the Dual UKF on the Lotka-Volterra system. The purpose of the files in this folder are as follow:
- HaresLynxData.mat - the raw data which the UKF utilizes.
- DualMain - the main script that needs to be run to do the estimation
- UKF_Params - the function that performs ONE ITERATION of the parameters ukf
- UKF - the function that performs ONE ITERATION of the states ukf
- ParamTransitionFunction - the ODE setup for the parameters. This function just applies the identity matrix to the parameters.
- Lotka_Volterra_Model - the ODE setup file for the Lotka-Volterra system, which is passed to the ODE solver
- MeasurementFcn - Function that resembles the measurement matrix in the UKF
- Dual_UKF_RealData_Figures - produces the dual UKF figures seen in the write up as well as a few extras

All other files are necessary for the main file to run but have not been extensively edited since received from Chow-Ferrer.
