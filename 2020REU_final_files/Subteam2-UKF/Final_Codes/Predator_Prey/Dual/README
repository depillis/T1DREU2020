This folder contains the code to run the Dual UKF on the Lotka-Volterra system. The purpose of the files in this folder are as follow:
- HaresLynxData.mat - the raw data which the UKF utilizes.
- DualMain - the main script that needs to be run to do the estimation
- UKF_Params - the function that performs ONE ITERATION of the parameters ukf
- UKF - the function that performs ONE ITERATION of the states ukf
- ParamTransitionFunction - the ODE setup for the parameters. This function just applies the identity matrix to the parameters.
- Lotka_Volterra_Model - the ODE setup file for the Lotka-Volterra system, which is passed to the ODE solver
- MeasurementFcn - Function that resembles the measurement matrix in the UKF
- Dual_UKF_RealData_Figures - produces the dual UKF figures seen in the write up as well as a few extras

Note that running DualMain.m will produce all figures automatically and the run time is pretty fast, around 10 seconds or so.

All other files are necessary for the main file to run but have not been extensively edited since received from Chow-Ferrer.
