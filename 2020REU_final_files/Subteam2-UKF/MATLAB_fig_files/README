Below we have ashort description of what each figure file contains and where it is generated:

Joint_mouse6_allstates.fig - This is a figure showing all the states from the best fit parameters from the Joint UKF algorithm
compared to the states when run on the baseline parameters. It was generated by StateSimulations.m in the Joint section of the T1D folder.
It is in the Appendix of the paper. 

Joint_mouse6_allstates_nowave.fig - This is an analogous figure to above, but shows the states when run on the NOD mouse with no wave.
It is also generated by StateSimulations.m and is also in the Appendix.

Joint_mouse6_subsetofstates.fig - This is a figure that shows a subset of states when run on the best fit parameters form the joint on mouse 6
and the baseline parameters. It was generated by StateSimulations.m. It is in the Results section of the paper. 

Joint_param_boxplots.fig = This figure contains the boxplots for everyparameter that moves more than 1%. It is generated by
Get_Box_Plots.m in the Joint section of the T1D folder. It is in the Kalman Filter section of the paper. 

joint_acuteall.fig - This figure contains the glucose plots for all of the best parameter fits for all the acute mice (mice 2-4,6-11). 
It is in the Kalman Filter section of the paper. It is generated by Produce_Full_Figure_joint.m in the Joint section of the T1D folder.

joint_progressive_all.fig - This figure contains the glucose plots for all of the best parameter fits for all the progressive mice (mice 1 and 5). 
It is in the Kalman Filter section of the paper. It is generated by Produce_Full_Figure_joint.m in the Joint section of the T1D folder.
